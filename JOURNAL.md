mostly just did research on keyboard layouts, what is and isn't feasible (how many layers since this is a small form factor) and [how to add oled screens](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/5xubd7/adding_oled_display_to_your_build_using_qmk/) (SSD1306) to a keyboard.

finished keyboard layout: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be8055d3-c477-4526-9e3a-de7b2f550f41)

installed KiCad and played around with it to learn some of its functions

time spent: ~1.5 hr
